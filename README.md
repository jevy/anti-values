# Master List of Company Values and Anti- Values

## About This List
The idea that a company has values is helpful: It gives everyone a common guide about how to make decisions, how to behave and other valuable things. However, if someone is saying "yes" to something, they implicitly say "no" to something else. 

Leadership is about saying "no" to lots of things to focus on what a company should be doing. 


## How to Use This List

Each "value spectrum" is designed to be opposites. If your current stance on a company value is on the left side of a value spectrum, you can't also say yes to the right side of the value spectrum. By saying "well, we do both" doesn't help your team understand how you PREFER them to behave; a way to frame this is: "default to..." to give people freedom if the situation warrants the opposite approach.

- Values can change over time based on the state of the organization. Feel free to revisit at any time. 
- Communicate these values to your organization. Please explain WHY you picked these values to default to so people can use them in their decision-making.

## Values

### Putting the company vs. Putting yourself or your company first 

*Putting the company first* - At this stage of the company, we need people to be all-in, and sacrifices will be made in your personal life. Maybe there will be long hours, things might get stressful, but we're committed to working together. The reasons for you being here (total compensation, mission, career-building) are making it worth it.

*Putting yourself/Family first* - We recognize this is a marathon, not a sprint. Building this company is a long haul, and we want to be sure you are fresh and ready to crush it when you're here at work. When your day is done, close your computer and do what you need to prepare for tomorrow. If you're suffering from burnout, we will give you paid time off and support you in how we can get you better.

### Performance

*Firing underperformers quickly* - We need people to be at the top of their game and perform well during your entire duration at the company. If performance drops, we will end termination and thank you for your time.

*Hiring for culture fit/potential and emphasis on coaching* - If people aren't performing well, this is mainly because the company didn't manage them well. Our managers give ample time (3+ months) to coach these individuals to a place of performance before considering more severe action.

### Deep Dive on the Problem vs. Document Assumptions and Act Quickly

*Deep Dive on the Problem or (Learn and Be Curious)* - We value high-quality products, and the cost of getting it wrong the first time is high. Taking the time to step back, take the time to think deeply about the Problem and design it right is vital. 

*Document Assumptions and Act Quickly* - The cost of failure on any particular piece of the product is low, so breaking things is okay. We don't have time to sit back and think deeply about a problem. When planning something, take the minimum time to plan it, document the assumptions you make and get it out there. We would instead learn from what our customers say about a feature. 

### Disagree and Commit VS. Democracy

Everyone comes to their opinion and speaks up with as much data and research as possible. There is no emotional investment in your idea. But when it comes down to it:

*Disagree and Commit* - If there is a decision, you have made your opinion known, and it wasn't the way we decided to go. You live with the decision and move forward without bitterness.

*Democracy* - We believe that everyone has valuable ideas, and the best idea should be the ones that everyone agrees to. Therefore, there isn't a veto vote, and we keep going until the group decides the best way to go.

### Invest in Future Time Saving vs Quick Fixes Now

*Invest in Future Time Saving* - Doing something once is fine, but if it looks like you (or someone else) will need to do the same thing again, take the time to build a process or software to make it easy for the next time.

*Fix it Quickly* - As you make a change, make a quick note for yourself and move on. It's impossible to know the future, so do the work and move on. [Yagni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) - "You Aren't Gonna Need It ."Only do the long-term work if you're sure you'll need it.

### Product Vision led vs Sales Driven

*Product led by Long-term vision* - We have a vision about how we want to change the future. Potential customers will come to us and offer to throw buckets of money at us, but we will turn them down unless those features are already part of our product vision. We are committed to changing the world with the picture we've built, even if we don't have any customers right now that understand it.

*Product lead by Sales* - Our company is driven by what our salespeople hear from the customers that will drive sales. While we have ideas, we want to do for our product, if a customer comes to us offering buckets of cash for a feature, that will trump our product vision every time. 

### We are a Team vs We are a Family


Lots of [discussion on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/shopify-ceo-were-a-team-not-family-5060180/) on both sides

*We are a Team, not a Family* - We are committed to each other so long as it is a valuable relationship for both parties. We will be friendly with each other, respect you as a person, but we will let you go if it doesn't work out.

*We are more than a team; we are a Family* - Family members are committed to each other through the good and the bad. If you have a hard time, the company will rally together and do whatever we can to help you get back. When you see others struggling, come alongside and support them, even if your work suffers. We are in it for the long haul.

### Rockstars - We value them slowing down for collaboration vs Going alone quickly

*Rockstars - Enabled to go alone quickly* - We prioritize enabling our rock stars to go alone and crush their work without interference from others. Things get done fastest this way. We encourage autonomy for people to make their own decisions on how things should be done, but they are accountable for their actions.

*Rockstars - Slow down to support the company*  - Rockstars will need to slow down compared to working alone for the sake of the broader company. They should coach others, inform and get feedback on their approaches and encourage broader collaboration in the company. We need to spread their expertise around

### Selfless Collaboration vs Defined Responsibilities

*Selfless Collaboration* - You have a particular set of valuable expertise. Whenever you see a place you can help, offer to do so and jump in, regardless of your defined role. Having your input will push the company forward.

*Defined Responsibilities* - You have a particular job, so stay in your lane and perform the work that comes at you exceptionally well. If someone asks for your help outside of your usual role, tell them so and get back to your defined work.

### Responding to Change vs Build a Robust Plan

*Responding to Change* - Responding to the market and what the customer wants is the best way to move things forward. Likely, things will be more chaotic, and we might be unfocused if we go about it without a firm plan, but we are positioning ourselves to listen to what the market wants.
